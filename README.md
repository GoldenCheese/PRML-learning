#	Solution Manual For PRML

### Before the Maintext
I am now getting back to update the solution manual, irregularly though :). Please feel free to contact me at <zqgao@fudan.edu.cn> or <zhengqi@mit.edu> (transition period). More detaild info can be found on my [homepage](https://zhengqigao.github.io/).

I have finished **Chapter1-Chapter11**, and all solutions have already been uploaded online.

I have several issues which need to be addressed here:
(1) I wrote this solution manual purely out of admiration of PRML, **and I have no will to publish this solutiona manual**, (2)It is only meant to be used as personal study reference, **please donnot take it for other purposes, e.g., upload to other websites or publication**. (3) If it is illegal (infringing the copyright), please contact me and I will withdraw this solution maunal immediately. (4) There is actually an official solution manual published by Springer. [You can find it here](https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9780387310732).

### Instruction
This is a solution manual for the famous book [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf). I will keep update the solutions as my learning process goes on.

There are some problems that I am not sure, which have been marked by "Waiting for update" in the solution manual. If you want to provide a solution for these unsolving problems, have any question, or come up with better ideas about any problem in the manual, please feel free to contact with me <zhengqigao@163.com> or <18212020014@fudan.edu.cn>

### Update List

**Sep 22,2018**

Hooray! Currently, I have finished all the solutions in Chapter 1-6 and already upload it online.

**Oct 23,2018**

Hooray! Currently, I have finished all the solutions before Chapter 7(included). However, the update process may be suspended lately because of the heavy workload of my lab projects.

**Nov 26,2018**

Hooray! Currently, I have (partly) finished chapter 8. Starting from section 8.4.4, I have found that many equations in the book are quite different from what I derive. Therefore, the corresponding exercises (8.19-8.29) are left behind. 

**Dec 24,2018**

Hooray! Currently, I have finished chapter 9. It is a good day today. Merry Christmas!

**Jan 31,2019**

Currently, I have finished all the problems before Problem 10.26. However, I may suspend updating the solution manual due to several personal reasons.

**Feb 19,2019**

I have got back to update the solution manual.

**Mar 5,2019**

Hooray! Currently, I have finished chapter 10 and already upload it online.

**Apr 1,2019**

Hooray! Currently, I have finished chapter 11 and already upload it online. Happy Fool's Day!

**Apr 10,2019**

The updating is suspended indefinitely, but I will get back to it someday in the future.

**Mar 10,2021**

I am back!
